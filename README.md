## The World of Alchemy
At the heart of alchemy is the practice of transmutation. The ability to transmute substances into other,
more useful substances is a valuable skill for any would-be crafter, and it starts with understanding
the world around us. Our world is fundamentally made of two things: materia and essentia.

Materia is the physical material that all objects are made from. Although in principle all matter is
interchangeable, in practice an alchemist will obtain poorer-quality materia from more common items,
and richer materia from rare items. Thus, materia comes in seven grades, from F rank through to A and S rank.
There are rumors of an eighth "omega" rank, but no concrete evidence of such a thing has ever surfaced.

Essentia, on the other hand, is the metaphysical essence of an object. You can't interact with it directly;
when not bound within an object, it must be dissolved into solution. There are thirteen known types of
essentia in this world, which have been named after the eight planets, plus Apollo (the Sun), Diana (the Moon),
the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and the mysterious Void.

Materia gives essentia substance, and essentia gives materia form. By breaking substances down into these two
elements and recombining them in different ways, new substances can be formed.

## Alchemical Machinery
There are three core devices that alchemists make heavy use of in their work. They are the Calcination
Furnace, Dissolution Chamber, and Synthesis Table. The Calcination Furnace uses solid fuel (the
same sort you'd use in a regular furnace) to burn off the essentia within a substance, leaving behind
only materia. The Dissolution Chamber does the reverse, using alkahest (the universal solvent) to break down
the materia of a substance and leave its essentia in solution. Finally, the materia and essentia can be
recombined in a Synthesis Table with a small sample of a desired substance to create more of the catalyst substance.

## Questions & Answers

**What sort of state is the mod in?**  
A very early one! The most basic functionality of the mod is there - the Calcination Furnace, Dissolution Chamber, and
Projection Table - but the mod lacks recipes for the vast majority of vanilla items and a lot of planned features. If you
want to help make recipes for the mod, you can head over to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/154XPt0xTNqfSSH5Ybp8lZ18sUFIr32FTcV5lL-OhrOQ/edit?usp=sharing) and suggest changes.

**Can you port this to Forge or an older Minecraft version?**  
No. I work on this mod in my spare time for fun; writing a port and maintaining multiple versions of the
mod just doesn't interest me. However, this project is licensed under MIT, so you are welcome to do it
yourself.

**Can you update the mod to the latest snapshot?**  
If the mod isn't up to date already, I'll update it when I get to it. In some cases, I have to wait for
dependencies to update before updating *Art of Alchemy*. Other times, I just haven't gotten around to it
yet. If you're impatient, you're welcome to update it yourself and submit a pull request.

**Can you add this cool feature I thought of?**  
Maybe! Submit an [issue](https://github.com/SynthRose/art-of-alchemy/issues) and I'll think about adding it.
Bear in mind, however, that I will likely prioritize finishing the core functionality over feature requests,
and I reserve the right to deny any suggestions. And if you're feeling especially enthusiastic, why not make
a fork of the mod with your dream feature, or submit a pull request?

**I found a bug! Can you fix it?**  
Oh no! Submit an [issue](https://github.com/SynthRose/art-of-alchemy/issues) here and hopefully I can get
it fixed soon. Please include any relevant crash reports, what you were doing, expected behavior, and other context.

**Your code stinks.**  
I know, sorry :( 

**Is the Minecraft bee trans?**  
Obviously.
